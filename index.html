                    <p>
                        Hi! I'm Ada, Countess of Lovelace and am an English 
                       mathematician and writer, chiefly known for my work on 
                       Charles Babbage's proposed mechanical general-purpose 
                       computer, the Analytical Engine.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I am one of the first to recognize that machines have 
                        applications beyond pure calculation, and to have 
                        published the first algorithm intended to be carried out 
                        by such a machine.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In my free time I like to read about scientific 
                        developments, mathematics, and computational mathematics. 
                        I also like to take my chances of winning big.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Fun fact! I've been programing for 6,616,408,472 seconds!

                        <p>I helped Charles Babbage on topics ranging from math 
                            to computation that helped the development of the 
                            Analytical Engine.</p>

                        <p>My work inspired the United States Department of 
                            Defense to name their new programming language after 
                            me.</p>
